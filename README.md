# SA_Assignment03

For this assignment, every assignment after this one, you will be required to do an estimate before doign the work.  And the to track how long it took to do the assignment.  And then briefly discuss your how you did on your estimate.

This will be done as in indiviual assignment.  Even though the assignments may be done as group, I want the estimates and reflection to be done as indidivuals.  I expect you to have different reflections than your group mates.

Submission:

* PDF that contains
  * a table that contains a row for each assignment, the estimate, the actual time, and brief discussion of estimate to actual.  Did you not account for something, were you too optimistic
  * Brief reflection on your estimation skills.  Are you an god at estimating tasks?  Did you have hit or misses?  Consistently too optimistic or pessimistic? Any patterns emerge?
